# Possible additions


- [ ] Command to return to initial matrix (recommencer?) This could be useful to illustrate how different choices can lead to the same final answer.

- [ ] Enable multiple row operations done in one step. This might be
 particularly useful for LaTeX output.

- [ ] Identify pivots in a different colour/background?  Or, perhaps do this only for
       row echelon form?

- [ ] Enable color customization

- [ ] Use Sympy for working with symbolic variables
